## Area of Triangles

A triangle is a three sided, two dimensional polygon. Generally there are two methods to calculate the area.

### Method 1
The area of a triangle can be calculated by multiplying 0.5 by the base length b by the perpendicular height h.

You can express this mathematically as:

### Method 2
However if the perpendicular height is not known or easily determined, trigonometry can be used such that all you need to know is the length of two sides and the size of the angle between those two sides.

Mathematically this is expressed as:

Note that whilst this formula chooses sides a and b and angle C, you could substitute these with any two known sides and the known angle in between.

### Terminology

Base - The bottom side of the triangle. Generally for the purpose of finding the area, you select a side that you know the length of, rotate the triangle so that it is at the bottom, and call it the base.

Perpendicular Height - The length that determines the height of the triangle. This must be perpendicular to the base side, and extend up to the highest vertex of the triangle.

Vertex - A corner of the triangle.

Sin - The sine trigonometry function. It expresses the fraction of the opposite side over the hypotenuse side of a right angled triangle.

### Examples
1. Find the area of a triangle which has a base length of 12 units and a perpendicular height of 4 units.
   
   Area = 0.5 x 12 x 4 = 24 units<sup>2</sup>

2. Find the area of a triangle which has one side with length 4, another side with length 6 and the angle between these two sides is 30 degrees.
   
   Area = 0.5 x 4 x 6 x sin 30 degrees = 6 units<sup>2</sup>
